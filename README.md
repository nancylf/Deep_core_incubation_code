# Deep_core_incubation_code
This document will be used to compile data that pertains to the NSF Goldstream and NGEE Arctic projects. 

The code evaluates greenhouse gas production from a deep sediment core (20 m) taken in 2018 from below Goldstream Lake, a field site approximately 15 km north of Fairbanks, Alaska.

Lake sediment samples were incubated under different oxygen conditions (aerobic and anaerobic), and at different temperatures (4C, 10C, and 20C). Gas samples were collected from jars at various time points, and were run on a gas chromatograph to determine methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

Emission data will be organized into data frames, tidied, and scaled into CH4 and CO2 fluxes per unit time. 
Data will be visualized by depth and type of gas released from the sediment.
